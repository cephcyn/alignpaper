This file describes the meaning of each column in the merged output CSVs:
- coreference.csv
- whitespace.csv
- (any single word).csv (since future pipeline runs may include different anchor selection methods, and therefore name the merged output CSV something different)

URL: a URL at which the paper that the abstract belongs to can be found
ID: within each set of input papers, each paper has a unique ID. So this is basically a "paper ID".
Type: Whether this sentence came from the "Title" of the paper or the "Abstract" of the paper.
Index: The index of the sentence within the section of the paper that it came from. For example, if this is the first sentence of the abstract, the Index is 0. If it is the second sentence of the abstract, the Index is 1. etc...
Text: The full, unedited text of the sentence/phrase.

split_0: the text literally preceding the anchor
split_1: the text that the anchor consists of
split_2: the text literally following the anchor
split_tokens: The list of tokens that makes up the sentence
within_anchor_index: the index of the search term within split_1 (so for example, the search term might be "BERT", split_1 anchor term might be "the model BERT", and within_anchor_index would be 10)
split_anchor_span: the span that the anchor phrase covers within split_tokens (so for example, if the anchor phrase was "the model BERT" which gets tokenized as ["the", "model", "BERT"] and the entire sentence was "we own the model BERT now" which gets tokenized as ["we", "own", "the", "model", "BERT", "now"], split_anchor_span would be (2, 5))
split_anchor_indices: same thing as split_anchor_span, except instead of dealing with tokens it deals with character indices based on the text from split_0, split_1, and split_2 being merged together

averb: the verb that is most closely related to the anchor phrase / the "verb that the anchor phrase interacts with"
averb_s: a list of all phrases that are marked as subjects of averb / on the left hand side of averb (this might be changed later)
averb_o: a list of all phrases that are marked as objects of averb / on the right hand side of averb (this might be changed later)
averb_relation: the relationship between the anchor phrase and averb. 1 if the anchor phrase is on the subject side, -1 if the anchor is on the object side, 0 if they overlap somehow (this should be uncommon)

root: the root word of the sentence as identified by dependency tree parsing
root_full: if the root word is a verb, then the entire main verb phrase of the sentence. otherwise it's just the root word again
root_s: a list of all phrases that are marked as subjects of root_full / on the left hand side of root_full (? unsure about the second part)
root_o: same thing as root_s but objects

fverb: the first verb that comes after the anchor phrase

apos: a list that represents the part of speech of the anchor, followed by the parts of speech of "parent" words of the anchor phrase in ascending order
apos_w: a list of the literal words associated with each of the parts of speech in apos, respectively

fword: the first word that follows the anchor phrase, excluding things like punctuation.
