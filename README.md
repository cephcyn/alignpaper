# alignpaper

If you use or build on this codebase, please let me know.

Start by reading `setup.sh`.

To run the web application...
- First make sure that the `alignpaper` conda environment exists
- For each script, open up a new terminal window (these scripts are blocking and have output)
- Run in order: `./run_redis.sh`, `./run_celery.sh`, `./run_flask.sh`, and finally `./run_react.sh`
